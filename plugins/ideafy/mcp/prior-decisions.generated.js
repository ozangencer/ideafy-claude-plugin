/**
 * How an evaluation or a plan checks itself against the project's other cards.
 *
 * Without this, the model only knows about a past decision when the user
 * links the card by hand with [[. The rule points it at two MCP tools
 * instead: search_cards for what was already decided (completed, withdrawn,
 * in flight) and list_open_work for unmerged work touching the same files.
 * Retrieval is the model's job; the tools only return short rows, never full
 * card HTML or diffs.
 *
 * Mode-independent on purpose: no branch, code or test wording beyond what a
 * Work project can also read, so a non-git project runs the same rule.
 *
 * Zero imports on purpose: scripts/sync-mcp-shared.mjs copies this file
 * verbatim into mcp-server/prior-decisions.generated.ts, which has to compile
 * inside mcp-server without the `@/` alias or the repo's lib/.

const PRIOR_DECISIONS_CHECK = `Check this card against the project's other cards before you commit to an approach. Use this card's \`id\` and \`projectId\` (get_card returns both):
- Past decisions: call \`search_cards\` with the \`projectId\`, 2-3 keywords from the task, and this card's \`id\` as \`excludeCardId\`. Read each hit by its status:
  - completed, test or progress: a decision. If this work contradicts it, that is a contradiction. A newer decision overrides an older one, but say why it should.
  - withdrawn: tried and abandoned, not a decision. Never call it a contradiction. Mention it as a precedent only when the reason it was dropped applies here too.
  Open a card with get_card only when its snippet is not enough.
- Open work: call \`list_open_work\` with the same \`projectId\` and \`excludeCardId\`, plus the files this card will change as \`files\` once you know them. Rows that share a file list it under \`overlap\`; otherwise compare against each card's files yourself. On an overlap, name the card, the shared file and which of the two should land first.
- Name a card by its bare displayId (IDE-318), never in backticks: it becomes a clickable link when saved.
- If \`search_cards\` or \`list_open_work\` is not available, or returns an error, skip this whole check and go straight on to the evaluation or the plan. Do not make up for the missing tool: never open the database (\`kanban.db\`, \`sqlite3\`), never query the card tables or the app's local API, never walk the codebase looking for other cards.`;
/**
 * A chain's other members are related work whether or not `search_cards`
 * finds them — a predecessor with no shared keyword never turns up there. The
 * chain comes from get_card's `chain` field or the prompt's own `## Chain`
 * section, so this part stands outside the check above and its "skip it when
 * the tools are missing" clause.
 */
const CHAIN_CONTEXT = `Chain: when get_card returns a \`chain\` field for this card, or this prompt has a \`## Chain\` section, the card is one step of a chain of cards. Its predecessors and successors are related work even when \`search_cards\` does not find them, and this part applies even when the check above was skipped. Name each by its bare displayId; a member without one (a draft) by its title.`;

 * conflicts go under Edge Cases, and extra work taken into scope becomes its

- If an open card brings in something this card needs to work correctly, or breaks it, that is extra work. When it is a precondition for this card, add it as its own step under Implementation Steps labelled "(because of <displayId>)"; otherwise suggest it as a note for the other card. Never widen the scope silently.
- Contradictions, precedents and overlaps go under Edge Cases. Do not add a heading for them.
If there is no contradiction, precedent or overlap, write nothing about it.

${CHAIN_CONTEXT}
- Under Dependencies, list the chain's predecessors and successors in chain order, each with its status.
- If a predecessor is neither completed nor withdrawn, add one sentence in the same section naming it as a sequencing risk: this card may land before work it builds on. It is a warning, not a blocker — do not stop, and do not reshape the plan around it.`;
/**
 * For the idea evaluation (one-shot Evaluate and the interactive ideation
 * session), which reports what it found in its own optional section. Only
 * here do ideas that were never decided count: a new idea can duplicate one
 * already waiting in Ideation or Backlog, and a plan cannot.
 */
export const PRIOR_DECISIONS_EVALUATION_RULE = `${PRIOR_DECISIONS_CHECK}
- Duplicates: call \`search_cards\` once more with the same keywords and \`statuses: ["ideation", "backlog"]\`. Those cards are ideas, not decisions; mention one only when it describes the same idea.
- Report what you found under \`## Related Cards\`, one line per card: its displayId, the kind (contradiction, precedent, duplicate or overlap, written in the output language), then what it decided or touches and why it matters here.

${CHAIN_CONTEXT}
- List the chain's predecessors and successors under \`## Related Cards\` too, in chain order, with the kind predecessor or successor (written in the output language) and each one's status. A chain member that is also a contradiction or an overlap gets one line, not two.

If there is no contradiction, precedent, duplicate or overlap and the card is in no chain, leave \`## Related Cards\` out entirely.
If the check was skipped because the tools were missing, \`## Related Cards\` holds only the chain lines — leave it out when there is no chain — and do not explain why.`;
