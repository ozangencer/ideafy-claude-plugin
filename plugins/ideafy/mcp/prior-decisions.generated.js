/**
 * How an evaluation or a plan checks itself against the project's other cards.
 *
 * Without this, the model only knows about a past decision when the user
 * links the card by hand with [[. The rule points it at two MCP tools
 * instead: search_cards for what was already decided (completed, withdrawn,
 * in flight) and list_open_work for unmerged work touching the same files.
 * Retrieval is the model's job; the tools only return short rows, never full
 * card HTML or diffs.
 *
 * Mode-independent on purpose: no branch, code or test wording beyond what a
 * Work project can also read, so a non-git project runs the same rule.
 *
 * Zero imports on purpose: scripts/sync-mcp-shared.mjs copies this file
 * verbatim into mcp-server/prior-decisions.generated.ts, which has to compile
 * inside mcp-server without the `@/` alias or the repo's lib/.

const PRIOR_DECISIONS_CHECK = `Check this card against the project's other cards before you commit to an approach. Use this card's \`id\` and \`projectId\` (get_card returns both):
- Past decisions: call \`search_cards\` with the \`projectId\`, 2-3 keywords from the task, and this card's \`id\` as \`excludeCardId\`. If a completed or withdrawn card decided something this work contradicts, name that card by its displayId. A newer decision overrides an older one; \`withdrawn\` means it was tried and abandoned. Open a card with get_card only when its snippet is not enough.
- Open work: call \`list_open_work\` with the same \`projectId\` and \`excludeCardId\`, plus the files this card will change as \`files\` once you know them. Rows that share a file list it under \`overlap\`; otherwise compare against each card's files yourself. On an overlap, name the card, the shared file and which of the two should land first.
- If these tools are not available, skip the check.`;
