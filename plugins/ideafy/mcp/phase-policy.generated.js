/**
 * Phase policy text — the <system-reminder> blocks the Ideafy hook injects on
 * every user turn, and the same text the MCP server hands back the moment a
 * session binds to a card.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: this module must stay import-free. mcp-server is a separate npm
 * package whose tsconfig pins `rootDir: "."`, and its dist/ is copied verbatim
 * into the Claude plugin where the repo's lib/ does not exist. So
 * scripts/sync-mcp-shared.mjs copies this file into
 * mcp-server/phase-policy.generated.ts on every mcp-server build. A single
 * import here breaks that copy's compile.
 *
 * The impure half of the old lib/hook-policy.ts — resolveEffectiveWorktree and
 * resolveProjectByFolderAncestor — stayed behind; hook-policy.ts re-exports
 * everything below so its importers did not have to move.
